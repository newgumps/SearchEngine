23150,37189856788674,"Fleurs de Cerisier Vase, Fuchsia","<p>The universally admired and wondrous blossoming of the Japanese cherry tree inspired the design of this masterpiece of interior decoration. A limited edition of 88 pieces — lucky number in Asian culture — captures the ornamental power of this iconic flower. The creation of each Lalique vase includes extensive time and skill: First, the piece is mouthblown using a crystal technique known as the “soufflé.” The vase's angular shape makes it hard to ensure a perfect distribution of the crystal while the overall size of the piece makes its handling complex — as a result, physical strength and dexterity are required by each craftsman. When the crystal is cold, the important carving work begins. The crystal is then satin-finished with matting baths and each petal of the flowers is stamped with pure liquid gold applied by hand as well as the numerous points of enamel. This stamping process alone takes more than 3 hours of manual craftsmanship.</p> <ul> <li>Limited edition of 88.</li> <li>Mouthblown crystal.</li> <li>Hand carved; gold-stamped accents.</li> <li>Handmade in France.</li> <li>11 3/4""W x 15 3/4""H.</li> </ul>",25000.00,,https://gumps.com/products/lalique-fleurs-de-cerisier-vase-fushcia,https://gumps-netsuites-extendfiles.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/870195_1.png,870195

A limited edition of 1,999 copies, with only 600 available in the English language for the world, the work will never be reprinted.</p>  <p>Employing ultra-high-resolution digital photography, along with the finest Italian bookmaking craftsmanship, “The Sistine Chapel” is comprised of three volumes.
